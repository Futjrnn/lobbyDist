We began building a decentralized lobbying application to empower people to fund lobbying efforts anonymously
and avoid prosecution. The idea is to level the playing field between large corporate interests and regular citizens.

During the hackathon we managed to get a basic web application built in Node/Angular5 and wrote up a few smart contracts
to handle creating a new "Issue" contract(the issue is a specific lobbying effort,) and a "Vote" contract.

The Vote contract is still unfinished but our plan for future development is to issue a single ERC721 token
to every address that puts ETH up in support of an issue. These tokens are then burned in order to vote on validating
materials submitted by a lobbyist to prove that they lobbied for the effort. Documents related to lobbying are stored
in IPFS and the hashes are revealed at voting time. 2 weeks after the lobbying verification documents are
submitted the vote closes, if a quorum of 60% is achieved & more than 50% of the votes affirm the lobbyist's
claims the lobbyist is paid the Ether stored in the Issue contract. If an issue is open for over 6 months
and no lobbyist submits validation materials, the issue closes and all ETH in the contract is returned to the original
senders 30 days after the contract closes. If validation materials are rejected, the issue closes and
the ether is returned after 60 days.
